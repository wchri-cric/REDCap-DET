# Introduction

I recently started trying out some PHP scripting in order to provide solutions for a few different REDCap related use cases. We'd made the decision not to run external code on our REDCap servers and Data Entry Triggers allow us to run the code on different machines from our main REDCap host. As my knowledge of PHP grows and REDCap matures this may change. But for now I have a small set of code for handling DETs.
